# Discord-DnD-Assistant

This Project Is A Discord Bot With Commands To Assist in the Quality of Running A Dungeons and Dragons Campaign.

The Bot is created using `Java Spring Boot` and the `Discord JDA`. The bot is deployed on Heroku. The bot exists on top of a Postgres Database, that I 
perform CRUD operations on using `Spring Data JPA`
